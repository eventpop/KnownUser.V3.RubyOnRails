# KnownUser.V3.RubyOnRails
The Queue-it Security Framework is used to ensure that end users cannot bypass the queue by adding a server-side integration to your server. 

## Introduction
When a user is redirected back from the queue to your website, the queue engine can attache a query string parameter (`queueittoken`) containing some information about the user. 
The most important fields of the `queueittoken` are:

 - q - the users unique queue identifier
 - ts - a timestamp of how long this redirect is valid
 - h - a hash of the token


The high level logic is as follows:

![The KnownUser validation flow](https://github.com/queueit/KnownUser.V3.RubyOnRails/blob/master/Documentation/KnownUser%20flow.PNG)

 1. User requests a page on your server
 2. The validation method sees that the has no Queue-it session cookie and no `queueittoken` and sends him to the correct queue based on the configuration
 3. User waits in the queue
 4. User is redirected back to your website, now with a `queueittoken`
 5. The validation method validates the `queueittoken` and creates a Queue-it session cookie
 6. The user browses to a new page and the Queue-it session cookie will let him go there without queuing again

## How to validate a user
To validate that the current user is allowed to enter your website (has been through the queue) these steps are needed:

 1. Providing the queue configuration to the KnownUser validation
 2. Validate the `queueittoken` and store a session cookie


### 1. Providing the queue configuration
The recommended way is to use the Go Queue-it self-service portal to setup the configuration. 
The configuration specifies a set of Triggers and Actions. A Trigger is an expression matching one, more or all URLs on your website. 
When a user enter your website and the URL matches a Trigger-expression the corresponding Action will be triggered. 
The Action specifies which queue the users should be send to. 
In this way you can specify which queue(s) should protect which page(s) on the fly without changing the server-side integration.

This configuration can then be downloaded to your application server. 
Read more about how *[here](https://github.com/queueit/KnownUser.V3.RubyOnRails/tree/master/Documentation)*. 
The configuration should be downloaded and cached for 5-10 minutes. 

### 2. Validate the `queueittoken` and store a session cookie
To validate that the user has been through the queue, use the `QueueIT::KnownUser.validateRequestByIntegrationConfig` method. 
This call will validate the timestamp and hash and if valid create a "QueueITAccepted-SDFrts345E-V3_[EventId]" cookie with a TTL as specified in the configuration.
If the timestamp or hash is invalid, the user is send back to the queue.


## Implementation
The KnownUser validation must *only* be done on *page requests*. 
So, if you add the KnownUser validation logic to a central place, then be sure that the Triggers only fire on page requests and not on e.g. image or ajax requests.

If we have the `integrationconfig.json` copied in the rails app folder then 
the following example of a controller is all that is needed to validate that a user has been through the queue:

```ruby
require 'sdk/Models'
require 'sdk/KnownUser'

class ResourceController < ApplicationController
	def index
		begin
			
			#Adding no cache headers to prevent browsers to cache requests
			response.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
			response.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache"
			response.headers["Expires"] = "Fri, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT"
			#end
			
			configJson = File.read('integrationconfig.json')
			customerId = "" # Your Queue-it customer ID
			secretKey = "" # Your 72 char secret key as specified in Go Queue-it self-service platform
		
		        requestUrl = request.original_url
			pattern = Regexp.new("([\\?&])(" + QueueIT::KnownUser::QUEUEIT_TOKEN_KEY + "=[^&]*)", Regexp::IGNORECASE)
			requestUrlWithoutToken = requestUrl.gsub(pattern, '')
			
			queueitToken = request.query_parameters[QueueIT::KnownUser::QUEUEIT_TOKEN_KEY.to_sym]

			# Verify if the user has been through the queue
			validationResult = QueueIT::KnownUser.validateRequestByIntegrationConfig(
				requestUrlWithoutToken,
				queueitToken,
				configJson,
				customerId,
				secretKey,
				cookies,
				request
			)

			if(validationResult.doRedirect)			
				# Send the user to the queue - either becuase hash was missing or becuase is was invalid
				redirect_to validationResult.redirectUrl
			else
				# Request can continue - we remove queueittoken form querystring parameter to avoid sharing of user specific token				
				if(requestUrl != requestUrlWithoutToken)
					redirect_to requestUrlWithoutToken
				end
			end
		rescue StandardError => stdErr
			# Log the Error
			puts stdErr.message
			raise
		end
	end
end
```

## Installation
Copy the sdk folder and content into your rails app inside its /lib folder


## Alternative Implementation
If your application server (maybe due to security reasons) is not allowed to do external GET requests, then you have three options:

1. Manually download the configuration file from Queue-it Go self-service portal, save it on your application server and load it from local disk
2. Use an internal gateway server to download the configuration file and save to application server
3. Specify the configuration in code without using the Trigger/Action paradigm. In this case it is important *only to queue-up page requests* and not requests for resources or AJAX calls. 
This can be done by adding custom filtering logic before caling the `QueueIT::KnownUser.validateRequestByLocalEventConfig` method. 

The following is an example of how to specify the configuration in code:

```ruby
class ResourceController < ApplicationController	
	def index	
		begin
		
			#Adding no cache headers to prevent browsers to cache requests
			response.headers["Cache-Control"] = "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"
			response.headers["Pragma"] = "no-cache"
			response.headers["Expires"] = "Fri, 01 Jan 1990 00:00:00 GMT"
			#end
			
			customerId = "" # Your Queue-it customer ID
			secretKey = "" # Your 72 char secret key as specified in Go Queue-it self-service platform		
			eventConfig = QueueIT::EventConfig.new
			eventConfig.eventId = "" # ID of the queue to use
			eventConfig.queueDomain = "xxx.queue-it.net" # Domian name of the queue - usually in the format [CustomerId].queue-it.net
			# eventConfig.cookieDomain = ".my-shop.com" # Optional - Domain name where the Queue-it session cookie should be saved
			eventConfig.cookieValidityMinute = 15 # Optional - Validity of the Queue-it session cookie. Default is 10 minutes
			eventConfig.extendCookieValidity = true # Optional - Should the Queue-it session cookie validity time be extended each time the validation runs? Default is true.
			# eventConfig.culture = "da-DK" # Optional - Culture of the queue ticket layout in the format specified here: https:#msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488(v=cs.20).aspx Default is to use what is specified on Event
			# eventConfig.layoutName = "NameOfYourCustomLayout" # Optional - Name of the queue ticket layout - e.g. "Default layout by Queue-it". Default is to take what is specified on the Event

			requestUrl = request.original_url
			queueitToken = request.query_parameters[QueueIT::KnownUser::QUEUEIT_TOKEN_KEY.to_sym]

			# Verify if the user has been through the queue
			validationResult = QueueIT::KnownUser.validateRequestByLocalEventConfig(
				requestUrl,
				queueitToken,
				eventConfig,
				customerId,
				secretKey,
				cookies
			)

			if(validationResult.doRedirect)			
				# Send the user to the queue - either becuase hash was missing or becuase is was invalid
				redirect_to validationResult.redirectUrl
			else
				# Request can continue - we remove queueittoken form querystring parameter to avoid sharing of user specific token				
				pattern = Regexp.new("([\\?&])(" + QueueIT::KnownUser::QUEUEIT_TOKEN_KEY + "=[^&]*)", Regexp::IGNORECASE)
				requestUrlWithoutToken = requestUrl.gsub(pattern, '')
				
				if(requestUrl != requestUrlWithoutToken)
					redirect_to requestUrlWithoutToken
				end
			end
		rescue StandardError => stdErr
			# Log the Error
			puts stdErr.message
			raise
		end
	end
end
```
